<h2>DREAM</h2>
<P>I dreamt I was in a digital metropolis, where every skyscraper was built from lines of code and glowing with vibrant, animated designs. I navigated through streets lined with sleek interfaces, where buttons and links pulsed like heartbeats. As I moved, I could see the underlying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript weaving together, forming a seamless tapestry of interactive experiences. Each click and scroll transformed the environment, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving web of possibilities. In this dream, I was both the architect and the explorer, shaping and discovering a boundless virtual world where innovation and creativity had no limits.</P>
